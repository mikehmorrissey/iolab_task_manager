#iolabs custom task manager

This is a task/job managing app I am building for iolabs. It still has a ways to go, but I'm making rapid progress.

Currently:

	-modeled user
	-sign in / sign out system
	-profile
	-employee index


in the works:
	- Note objects belonging to User (for easy company communication)
	- Task/Job objects belonging to User
	- Task index for listing out/ organizing tasks
	- User tasks on profile (show) page
	- User edit/ update actions
	- more User attributes
